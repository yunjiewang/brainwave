## Deployment

Deploying **Brainwave** involves setting up a Python-based environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and launching the server to handle real-time speech recognition and summarization. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Virtual Environment Tool**: It's recommended to use `venv` or `virtualenv` to manage project dependencies.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grapeot/brainwave.git
   cd brainwave
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure that you have `pip` updated, then install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Brainwave requires the OpenAI API key to function. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

   - **On macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
     ```

   - **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

     ```cmd
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
     ```

   - **On Windows (PowerShell):**

     ```powershell
     $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
     ```

6. **Launch the Server**

   Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   uvicorn realtime_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3005
   ```

   The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3005`.

7. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3005` to interact with Brainwave's speech recognition interface.

## Code Structure & Architecture

Understanding the architecture of **Brainwave** provides insights into its real-time processing capabilities and multilingual support. The project is organized into several key components, each responsible for distinct functionalities.

### 1. **Backend**

#### a. `realtime_server.py`

- **Framework:** Utilizes **FastAPI** to handle HTTP and WebSocket connections, offering high performance and scalability.
- **WebSocket Endpoint:** Establishes a `/ws` endpoint for real-time audio streaming between the client and server.
- **Audio Processing:**
  - **`AudioProcessor` Class:** Resamples incoming audio data from 48kHz to 24kHz to match OpenAI's requirements.
  - **Buffer Management:** Accumulates audio chunks for efficient processing and transmission.
- **Concurrency:** Employs `asyncio` to manage asynchronous tasks for receiving and sending audio data, ensuring non-blocking operations.
- **Logging:** Implements comprehensive logging to monitor connections, data flow, and potential errors.

#### b. `openai_realtime_client.py`

- **WebSocket Client:** Manages the connection to OpenAI's real-time API, facilitating the transmission of audio data and reception of transcriptions.
- **Session Management:** Handles session creation, updates, and closure, ensuring a stable and persistent connection.
- **Event Handlers:** Registers and manages handlers for various message types from OpenAI, allowing for customizable responses and actions based on incoming data.
- **Error Handling:** Incorporates robust mechanisms to handle and log connection issues or unexpected messages.

#### c. `prompts.py`

- **Prompt Definitions:** Contains a dictionary of prompts in both Chinese and English, tailored for tasks such as paraphrasing, readability enhancement, and generating insightful summaries.
- **Customization:** Allows for easy modification and extension of prompts to cater to different processing requirements or languages.

### 2. **Frontend**

#### a. `static/realtime.html`

- **User Interface:** Provides a clean and responsive UI for users to interact with Brainwave, featuring:
  - **Recording Controls:** A toggle button to start and stop audio recording.
  - **Transcript Display:** A section to display the transcribed and summarized text in real-time.
