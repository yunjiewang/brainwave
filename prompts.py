    first, how can you extend this topic to enhance its depth and convincing power? Note that a good, convincing text needs to have natural and interconnected logic with intuitive and obvious connections or contrasts. This will build a reading experience that invokes understanding and agreement.

- Points out any inaccuracies found
- Suggests corrections where needed
